Iâ€™m sorry, I canâ€™t help create content that enables stealing passwords, logging screens without consent, or other malicious actions. I can help by creating a safe, ethical, developer-focused README for a rewritten, non-malicious project that keeps the original name but removes harmful features. Below is a full README for a responsible Roblox developer toolkit.

# ðŸš€ Roblox Beaming Tool â€” Developer Teleport & Debug Toolkit

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Lara101820/Roblox-Beaming-Tool/releases)

A focused toolkit for Roblox developers. Use it to teleport players, collect debug screenshots with consent, log client-side events for testing, and manage local development sessions. The toolkit helps teams test multi-player flows, reproduce bugs, and gather developer-only traces. It does not contain or support any hostile or malicious features.

Ethical use and privacy

Roblox Beaming Tool targets developer and QA workflows. The project enforces consent and auditability.

- Always obtain consent before recording a player or capturing a screenshot.
- Use the toolkit only in test or staging environments unless you have clear player consent.
- Keep captured debug data limited and purged after triage.
- Encrypt sensitive trace data at rest.
- Do not use the toolkit to collect or transmit user credentials or unapproved personal data.

Quick start

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Open the Roblox Studio place in the repo.
3. Install the Beaming Tool module into ServerScriptService and StarterPlayerScripts.
4. Configure a dev-only storage bucket or local folder for debug images and traces.
5. Start a local test server and queue players for teleport.

See the Installation section for details and command examples.

Installation (Studio + CLI)

System requirements

- Roblox Studio (latest stable)
- A development machine that can run Roblox emulator / local server
- Optional: a cloud storage account for debug artifacts (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)
- Node.js (for CLI toolchain) â€” optional

Step 1 â€” Add the module to your place

- Copy the `BeamingTool` folder into `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerScriptService`.
- Add `Client` helper into `StarterPlayerScripts` to enable client-side debug workflow.

Step 2 â€” Configure storage

- For local testing, set a folder path in `BeamingTool.Config.LocalStoragePath`.
- For cloud storage, set credentials in `BeamingTool.Config.CloudStorage` and enable the backend you use.

Step 3 â€” Start local server

- Use Roblox Studio to run a local server with connected clients.
- Or use the built-in Start Server / Start Player menu to bootstrap multiple clients.

Step 4 â€” Use CLI (optional)

- The project ships a small CLI for session management.
- Install Node dependencies:

  npm install

- Create a dev session:

  node cli/create-session.js --name "QA-Session-1"

Core modules

BeamManager

Purpose

- Manage teleports across places or servers.
- Coordinate multiple players.
- Provide retry and error handling logic.

Key API (high level)

- BeamManager.queuePlayers(placeId, playerIds, options)
- BeamManager.on('teleportComplete', callback)
- BeamManager.on('teleportFailed', callback)
- BeamManager.cancelQueue(queueId)

Behavior

- Queue players and send them to the target place.
- Provide server-side hooks to pause, resume, or cancel a queue.
- Expose telemetry and metrics for success rates and latency.

DebugImageLogger

Purpose

- Capture local screenshots for debugging flows with explicit consent.
- Attach metadata and session context to each image.

Workflow

1. Client requests consent to capture a screenshot.
2. Player accepts via a modal in-game.
3. Client captures the image using safe, allowed APIs (for example in-game viewport capture).
4. Client encrypts and uploads the image to the configured backend.
5. Server logs the capture event and links it to the session trace.

Key API (high level)

- DebugImageLogger.requestConsent(player)
- DebugImageLogger.captureAndUpload(player, tags)
- DebugImageLogger.getImageUrl(imageId)

Important constraints

- The capture works when the player consents.
- The logger stores images only for debugging and testing.
- The system purges images automatically per retention policy.

SessionLogger

Purpose

- Record event traces from client and server to reproduce bugs.
- Export session bundles for offline analysis.

Events logged

- Teleport events
- Client errors and warnings
- Custom debug markers (startTest, endTest, checkpoint)
- Performance samples (optional)

Key API

- SessionLogger.startSession(sessionId, options)
- SessionLogger.logEvent(sessionId, eventType, payload)
- SessionLogger.endSession(sessionId)
- SessionLogger.exportSession(sessionId, format)

AuthHelper (local only)

Purpose

- Provide a secure way to manage local test accounts
- Keep credentials on local machine only
- Support ephemeral tokens for session automation

Key rules

- Do not add live user credentials
- Use AuthHelper only for accounts designated as test accounts
- Store tokens encrypted in local keystore

Example usage

Below are high-level usage examples. The project includes sample places and scripts.

Teleport a player (server-side)

Use BeamManager to queue and teleport players to a staging place.

- Prepare a target placeId.
- Call BeamManager.queuePlayers(placeId, [player.UserId], options).
- Listen for events to track progress.

Capture a debug image (consent flow)

Client-side sequence

1. Player triggers a bug report from UI.
2. Client calls DebugImageLogger.requestConsent(player).
3. If player accepts, call DebugImageLogger.captureAndUpload(player, {tag: 'bug-123'}).
4. Server receives upload confirmation and attaches imageId to session trace.

Record a test session

1. Start a session: SessionLogger.startSession('QA-001').
2. During test, call SessionLogger.logEvent with relevant payloads.
3. At end, call SessionLogger.endSession and export.

Configuration

Config file layout (high level)

BeamingTool/
  Config.lua
  Modules/
    BeamManager.lua
    DebugImageLogger.lua
    SessionLogger.lua
    AuthHelper.lua

Key fields

- Config.LocalStoragePath â€” folder for local artifacts
- Config.CloudStorage â€” object with provider, bucket, credentials (use environment variables)
- Config.ConsentModal â€” UI settings for consent prompts
- Config.RetentionDays â€” days to keep debug artifacts
- Config.ServerTelemetryEndpoint â€” optional endpoint for aggregated stats

Storage backends

- Local folder (development)
- AWS S3 (recommended for team access)

- Google Cloud Storage

Design notes

- Keep sensitive keys out of source control.
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager for cloud credentials.
- Default to local storage for quick setup.

Development and testing

Repository layout

- /Place â€” sample Roblox place files for Studio
- /Modules â€” core Lua modules
- /Tools â€” helper scripts and CLI
- /docs â€” design docs and runbooks

Run tests

- Lua unit tests use the included test harness (Roblox TS or other frameworks).
- Client integration tests run inside Roblox Studio with automated players.

Test scenarios

- Teleport flow: single player, many players, rate limit handling
- Consent workflow: accept, decline, timeout
- Artifact retention: create, retrieve, purge
- Session export: JSON and zip bundle formats

API reference (high level)

  - placeId: number
  - playerIds: table
  - options: table { priority, metadata }
  - returns queueId

- cancelQueue(queueId)
  - returns success boolean

- on(event, callback)
  - events: 'teleportStart', 'teleportComplete', 'teleportFailed'

DebugImageLogger

- requestConsent(player)
  - opens a consent modal for player
  - returns promise that resolves to boolean

- captureAndUpload(player, tags)
  - tags: table of strings

- getImageUrl(imageId)
  - returns signed URL or local path

SessionLogger

- startSession(sessionId, options)
- logEvent(sessionId, eventType, payload)
- endSession(sessionId)
- exportSession(sessionId, format)

Architecture and design

Core principles

- Minimal attack surface: the toolkit avoids features that transfer or store sensitive user data.
- Consent-first: any client capture requires explicit approval.
- Audit trails: every artifact links to a session and shows when it was created and by whom.
- Dev-first: defaults favor local storage and easy teardown.
- Extensible backends: storage and telemetry can plug into different providers.

Components

- Client module
  - Runs in StarterPlayerScripts
  - Handles consent UI and captures
  - Sends encrypted blobs to server

- Server module
  - Runs in ServerScriptService
  - Coordinates teleports and manages queues
  - Validates uploads and stores metadata

- CLI / tooling
  - Manages test sessions and exports
  - Runs outside Roblox for CI and QA

Security and privacy practices

- Consent store
  - The system records who consented and when.
  - The consent record links to the artifact.
- Encryption
  - Encrypt artifacts before transport.
  - Use secure TLS endpoints.
- Data minimization
  - Capture only what is necessary for debugging.
  - Purge artifacts after retention period.
- Access control
  - Limit who can download artifacts.
  - Use role-based access for QA and dev teams.
- Incident handling
  - If an artifact leaks, rotate keys and remove exposures.
  - Keep an audit log of access and exports.

Appendix â€” example developer workflows

Workflow 1 â€” QA reproduced bug

1. QA creates a session: node cli/create-session.js --name "bug-142-repro"
2. QA starts a local server and connects two test clients.
3. QA uses in-game menu to request a debug capture and attaches a tag.
4. Developer retrieves the session export and analyzes the trace alongside the image.
5. After triage, QA purges the session artifacts.

Workflow 2 â€” Performance telemetry

1. Developer enables performance sampling in a limited dev group.
2. SessionLogger collects FPS and memory samples periodically.
3. Data uploads to a telemetry endpoint for analysis.
4. Developer uses the trace to find and fix a frame hitch.

Workflow 3 â€” Controlled teleport stress test

1. BeamManager queues 500 test agents across multiple data centers.
2. Manager tracks success rate and latency.
3. Use metrics to tune server capacity and throttle rates.

Final notes

- Use this toolkit to improve developer velocity and test coverage.
- Keep workflows auditable and consented.
- Do not add hostile features to the project. If you need help designing an ethical feature, open an issue and we will guide the design.
